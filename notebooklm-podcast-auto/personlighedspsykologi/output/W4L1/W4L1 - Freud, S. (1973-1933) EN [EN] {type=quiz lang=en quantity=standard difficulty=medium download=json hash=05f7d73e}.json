      "question": "According to Freud's lecture, why did psycho-analysis originally focus on symptoms rather than the ego?",

        {
          "text": "Symptoms are the most foreign mental contents to the ego.",
          "isCorrect": true,
          "rationale": "Freud notes that it was not a matter of indifference that work began on symptoms, which represent the repressed and are 'internal foreign territory' to the ego."
        },
        {
          "text": "The ego was already well understood by popular psychology at the time.",
          "isCorrect": false,
          "rationale": "While it coincided with popular psychology, Freud states the ego only seemed self-evident and he expected to find unprepared-for complexities within it."
        },
        {
          "text": "Early psycho-analysis lacked the scientific tools to study the repressing forces.",
          "isCorrect": false,
          "rationale": "Freud attributes the delay to the laborious nature of scientific progress and the inability to study every field simultaneously, not a lack of specific tools."
        },
        {
          "text": "Symptoms were considered more socially acceptable to discuss than the ego.",
          "isCorrect": false,
          "rationale": "The text suggests the opposite; psycho-analysis faced objections because it dealt with sexuality and instincts rather than 'nobler' impulses."
        }
      ],
      "hint": "Consider Freud's description of symptoms as 'internal foreign territory' derived from the repressed."

          "isCorrect": true,

        {
          "text": "The mind is inherently fragile and easily shattered by external reality.",
          "isCorrect": false,
          "rationale": "While the crystal breaks, the emphasis is on the pattern of the fragments revealing internal structure, not the fragility of the mind itself."

        {
          "text": "Psychological trauma causes haphazard and unpredictable damage to the personality.",
          "isCorrect": false,

          "text": "The ego can never be repaired once a 'breach or rent' has occurred.",

      "answerOptions": [
        {
          "text": "It is the result of the child internalizing parental authority and restrictions.",
          "isCorrect": true,

          "text": "It is an innate biological mechanism present from the moment of birth.",
          "isCorrect": false,

          "text": "It develops through the child’s early observations of social laws and ethics.",

          "text": "Object-choice is more permanent than identification.",
          "isCorrect": false,
