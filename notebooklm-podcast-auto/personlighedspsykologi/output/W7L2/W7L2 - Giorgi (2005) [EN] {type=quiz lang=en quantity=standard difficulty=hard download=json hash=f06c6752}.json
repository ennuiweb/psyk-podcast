    {
      "question": "According to Giorgi, why did he eventually turn to phenomenological philosophy as a basis for psychological methodology?",
      "answerOptions": [
        "He believed experimental psychology was too focused on philosophical anthropology rather than data.",
        "He found that standard quantitative procedures failed to address genuine psychological questions.",
        "He sought a way to better align psychological facts with the medical model of pathology.",
        "He wanted to simplify the complex variables found in behaviorist animal research."
      ],
      "rationale": "The author notes that his training in experimental psychology led him to realize that mainstream methods missed the essential psychological essence of human experience. This led to a search for a non-reductionistic methodology that could adequately study persons.",
      "hint": "Consider the author's critique of standard experimental and quantitative procedures in his early career."
    },
    {
      "question": "In the context of the 1960s academia described by Giorgi, which of the following was a dominant characteristic of psychology?",
      "answerOptions": [
        "The use of animals as primary subjects and a focus on behaviorism.",
        "A widespread adoption of self-determining, humanistic frameworks.",
        "The rejection of the medical model in favor of moral perspectives.",
        "A preference for qualitative over quantitative measurement."
      ],
      "rationale": "During that era, behaviorism and experimental paradigms using animals were the prevailing standards in academic settings. This environment prioritized external observation and quantifiable data over internal human experience.",
      "hint": "Think about the specific movement and subject type that humanistic psychologists were protesting against."
    },
    {
      "question": "Joseph Royce used the term 'encapsulated person' to describe which type of individual in the scientific community?",
      "answerOptions": [
        "A researcher who focuses solely on the unpredictable nature of humans.",
        "A scientist who is aware of the historical nature of human existence.",
        "A professional who relies on one approach and claims it is the only valid one.",
        "A clinician who rejects the medical model in favor of intuition."
      ],
      "rationale": "Encapsulation refers to a lack of flexibility and an inability to see beyond one's own methodological bias. This concept highlights the 'means-centered' rigidity that early humanistic psychologists aimed to overcome.",
      "hint": "This term relates to a lack of flexibility and methodological narrowness."
    },
    {
      "question": "How did Abraham Maslow critique the standard 'science' of psychology during the mid-20th century?",
      "answerOptions": [
        "He argued it was too courageous and took too many methodical risks.",
        "He claimed it was 'means-centered' and prioritized caution over creativity.",
        "He suggested it was too focused on individual results rather than general laws.",
        "He criticized its lack of technical precision and slow pace of discovery."
      ],
      "rationale": "Maslow believed that the obsession with 'not making mistakes' and following technical procedures hindered true creativity and significant results. He advocated for a more comprehensive and intuitive approach to understanding persons.",
      "hint": "Look for the distinction between being 'technically precise' and being 'results directed'."
    },
    {
      "question": "According to Giorgi, what is the 'ultimate challenge' currently facing humanistic psychologists in terms of methodology?",
      "answerOptions": [
        "Integrating more animal research to validate humanistic findings.",
        "Inventing science freshly by investigating human problems in an 'originary' way.",
        "Refining quantitative measures to meet the standards of the Psychonomic Society.",
        "Adopting Newton's laws of motion as fundamental axioms for personhood."
      ],
      "rationale": "The author suggests that instead of imitating natural science, humanistic psychology must dialogue with real human beings and develop its own rigorous conceptual framework. This requires moving away from established natural science criteria to see what human phenomena actually demand.",
      "hint": "Consider the suggestion to 'bracket' the hold that the natural sciences have on our imagination."
    },
    {
      "question": "Kimble (1996) argued that for psychology to be a science, it must adhere to which specific criteria?",
      "answerOptions": [
        "It must be deterministic, empirical, and analytic.",
        "It must be intuitive, subjective, and holistic.",
        "It must be moral, unpredictable, and self-transcendent.",
        "It must be non-reductionistic, qualitative, and ontological."
      ],
      "rationale": "Kimble's program sought to unify psychology as a natural science, which Giorgi argues is inherently incompatible with humanistic values such as freedom and experiential depth. These criteria represent the Newtonian-style axioms that humanistic psychology opposes.",
      "hint": "These criteria are based on the rules used by the sciences of nature to study physical forces."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the primary reason Giorgi advocates for qualitative analysis in human science research?",
      "answerOptions": [
        "It is the only method that can provide statistically significant frequency data.",
        "It allows for the abstraction of variables from their natural contexts.",
        "It reveals the intrinsic relationships among meanings and motivational links.",
        "It ensures that the researcher remains completely objective and detached."
      ],
      "rationale": "Qualitative analysis is seen as essential for capturing the lived meanings and values that define psychological life. Unlike quantitative methods, it can map the network of motivations that guide human action in specific situations.",
      "hint": "Think about what type of analysis best clarifies the meanings by which people live."
    },
    {
      "question": "In a 'genuine nonreductionistic science,' how does Giorgi view the relationship between the researcher and the participant?",
      "answerOptions": [
        "The researcher should remain free while the participant's expressiveness is constrained.",
        "No interpretive characteristic can be denied to the participant that the researcher claims for themselves.",
        "The participant should be treated as an observable object to maintain empirical rigor.",
        "The researcher must use 'bracketing' to ensure the participant's history is ignored."
      ],
      "rationale": "The author argues against the double standard where researchers use capacities like freedom and interpretation while denying them to 'robotlike' participants. A human science must acknowledge the full humanness of both parties involved in the research situation.",
      "hint": "Consider the critique of the 'robotlike participant' in experimental studies."
    },
    {
      "question": "According to the text, what is the current organizational status of humanistic psychology (Division 32) within the American Psychological Association (APA)?",
      "answerOptions": [
        "It represents the majority of psychologists, making the term humanistic redundant.",
        "It is a significant force, comprising roughly $10\\%$ of the total membership.",
        "It remains a small minority, accounting for less than $0.5\\%$ of the total membership.",
        "It has been absorbed into the Psychonomic Society to form a unified science."
      ],
      "rationale": "With only 610 members out of 150,000, humanistic psychology is deeply marginalized within the larger organization. This statistic supports the author's claim that the movement is granted a presence mostly at the margins of the field.",
      "hint": "The author mentions that there are only 610 members in Division 32 compared to 150,000 total members."
    },
    {
      "question": "Giorgi describes the humanistic movement as a 'necessary corrective' to which era's mainstream psychology?",
      "answerOptions": [
        "The late 19th-century focus on structuralism and introspection.",
        "The mid-20th-century dominance of behaviorism and strict psychoanalysis.",
        "The modern era's shift toward cognitive neuroscience and genetics.",
        "The post-modern rejection of any scientific criteria in psychology."
      ],
      "rationale": "The movement arose in the late 1950s and 1960s to restore a complex image of the person that had been reduced by deterministic models. It challenged the idea that humans could be understood solely through stimulus-response or pathology-laden interpretations.",
      "hint": "Think about the 'Third Force' and what it stood against during its inception."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Rollo May's approach to the person differ from purely abstract scientific generalizations?",
      "answerOptions": [
        "He believed generalizations must precede the encounter with the phenomenon.",
        "He sought to ground personal understanding ontologically in the dimension of 'being.'",
        "He argued that psychology should be the 'tail on the body of medicine.'",
        "He focused primarily on anatomical and physiological values."
      ],
      "rationale": "May emphasized that without respecting the dimension of 'being,' psychological analysis remains shallow. He argued for moving from the abstract to the concrete, ensuring that knowledge follows an actual encounter with the human person.",
      "hint": "The keyword here relates to the branch of philosophy that deals with the nature of existence."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does Giorgi argue that psychological variables cannot be isolated in the same way as physical variables?",
      "answerOptions": [
        "Because human experience is synthetic and variables are embedded within each other.",
        "Because qualitative analysis makes it impossible to define what a variable is.",
        "Because participants are too unpredictable to follow experimental instructions.",
        "Because ethical constraints prevent the use of independent and dependent variables."
      ],
      "rationale": "In human life, functions like memory, perception, and emotion are lived simultaneously and contextually. Attempting to hold one constant while varying another, as one does in physics, distorts the actual lived experience of the person.",
      "hint": "Consider the relationship between a participant's memory and their perception during a study."
