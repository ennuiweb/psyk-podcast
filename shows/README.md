# Shows

Each subdirectory contains config and assets for a single podcast feed.

- `social-psychology` – live show wired to Google Drive and GitHub Actions.
- `intro-vt` – scaffolding ready for the "Intro + VT" feed. Populate configs before publishing.

Add new shows by creating a sibling directory that mirrors this structure.
