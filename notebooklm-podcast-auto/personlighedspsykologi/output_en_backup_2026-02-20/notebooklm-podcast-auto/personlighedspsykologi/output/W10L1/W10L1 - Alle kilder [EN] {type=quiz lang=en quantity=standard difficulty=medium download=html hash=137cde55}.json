          "text": "Gender refers to lateral relationships between peers, while sexual difference refers to vertical relationships between generations.",
          "isCorrect": true,
          "rationale": "Mitchell uses 'gender' to describe the fluid, polymorphic possibilities among siblings and peers, whereas 'sexual difference' describes the structural, generational boundary established by the unconscious law."

        {
          "text": "Gender is a biological category, whereas sexual difference is purely a sociological construct.",
          "isCorrect": false,
          "rationale": "This reverses the typical usage in feminist theory where gender is usually the social construct, and Mitchell specifically rejects the schism between biology and psychology."
        },
        {
          "text": "Gender is invariant across cultures, while sexual difference varies based on social practices.",
          "isCorrect": false,
          "rationale": "Mitchell argues the opposite: that the distinction of sexual difference is universal/invariant, while the expressions of gender are diverse and changeable."

        {
          "text": "Gender is an unconscious process, while sexual difference is a conscious performance.",
          "isCorrect": false,
          "rationale": "In Mitchell's framework, both are rooted in the psyche, but 'performance' is a concept she associates more with Butler's theory of gender than her own view of sexual difference."
