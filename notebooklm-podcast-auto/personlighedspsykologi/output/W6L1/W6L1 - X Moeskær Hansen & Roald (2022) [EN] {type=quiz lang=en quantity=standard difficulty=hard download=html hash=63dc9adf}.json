      "question": "In the context of 19th-century German aesthetics, Robert Vischer used the term empathy ($\\textit{Einf\\ddot{u}hlung}$) to describe which psychological process?",
      "answerOptions": [
        {
          "text": "The subconscious projection of one's own bodily sensations and mental state into the form of an object.",
          "isCorrect": true,
          "rationale": "Vischer proposed that the subject objectifies their own body and mind into an object, resulting in a 'sublimation of the senses' where the entire subject is moved by the form."
        },
        {
          "text": "The intellectual recognition of the artist's intended emotional meaning through symbolic analysis.",
          "isCorrect": false,
          "rationale": "Vischer's concept moved away from purely symbolic or intellectual interpretation toward a focus on the subjective, bodily conditions of the spectator."
        },
        {
          "text": "The moral development of prosocial behavior through the observation of suffering in tragic art.",
          "isCorrect": false,
          "rationale": "While empathy is linked to prosocial behavior in social psychology, Vischer's original aesthetic definition was centered on the psychological function of objectifying the self into form."
        },
        {
          "text": "The mirroring of neurons in the motor cortex when observing the brushstrokes of a painting.",
          "isCorrect": false,
          "rationale": "Neuroscientific explanations involving mirror neurons are a contemporary development, whereas Vischer's 1873 work focused on the sublimation of sensations and imagination."

      ],
      "hint": "Consider the transition from a focus on the symbol to a focus on the subjective conditions of the observer."

      "question": "Theodor Lipps distinguishes 'basic empathy' (general apperceptive empathy) from 'aesthetic empathy' by which of the following criteria?",
      "answerOptions": [
        {
          "text": "Basic empathy is an interaction with non-living things, whereas aesthetic empathy only occurs with other human beings.",
          "isCorrect": false,
          "rationale": "Lipps argued that empathy is a general function involved in experiencing objects, nature, and people alike; the distinction lies in the completion and harmony of the experience."
        },
        {
          "text": "Basic empathy is the general function of perceiving an object as manifesting activity, while aesthetic empathy requires a life-affirming harmony between the person and the object.",
          "isCorrect": true,
          "rationale": "Basic empathy provides the ground for all object perception as activity, but only when this activity agrees with one's dispositions and produces pleasure does it reach the 'peak' of aesthetic sympathy."
        },
        {
          "text": "Basic empathy is a voluntary act of imagination, while aesthetic empathy is an involuntary physiological response.",
          "isCorrect": false,

        {
          "text": "Basic empathy involves the projection of negative emotions, whereas aesthetic empathy is strictly limited to positive beauty.",
          "isCorrect": false,
          "rationale": "Basic empathy is the underlying mechanism for both positive and negative evaluations; aesthetic empathy specifically refers to the completion of the sympathetic relation."

          "text": "The activity demanded by the object is experienced as being in disagreement with the spectator's basic dispositions.",
          "isCorrect": true,
          "rationale": "Negative empathy arises when the spontaneous evaluation of the object's demanded activity creates a sense of being 'not bound' or in conflict with the external object."

          "text": "The spectator's focus is distracted by the practical interests of mundane life.",
          "isCorrect": false,
          "rationale": "Lipps's 'aesthetic reality' detaches the viewer from practical interests, but negative empathy specifically concerns the clash between internal dispositions and external demands."

          "text": "The border demarcating the spectator from the painting remains intact, so the sense is lived and objective simultaneously.",
