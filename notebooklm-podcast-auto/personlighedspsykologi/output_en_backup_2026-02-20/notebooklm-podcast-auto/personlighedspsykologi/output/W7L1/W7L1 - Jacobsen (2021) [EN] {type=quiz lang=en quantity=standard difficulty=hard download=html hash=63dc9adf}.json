      "question": "According to the source material, why is the study of existence fundamentally different from traditional scientific inquiry?",
      "answerOptions": [
        {
          "text": "Existence is not an objective 'thing' that lies before us, but rather unfolds within the individual in the immediate moment.",
          "isCorrect": true,
          "rationale": "Science focuses on objects, historical events, or chemical substances that can be categorised 'out there', whereas existence is a subjective process that vanishes the moment we attempt to observe it like an object."
        },
        {
          "text": "Existence is too complex to be captured by the limited tools of modern empirical psychology and neurobiology.",
          "isCorrect": false,
          "rationale": "While complexity is a factor, the text emphasizes the ontological difference between 'objects' and the 'subjective unfolding' rather than just a lack of advanced tools."
        },
        {
          "text": "Scientific inquiry is limited to the physical realm, while existence is purely a metaphysical and religious phenomenon.",
          "isCorrect": false,
          "rationale": "The text suggests that even daily activities like reading or parking a car are existential, implying it is not limited to the metaphysical but is simply a different mode of being."
        },
        {
          "text": "The variable nature of human behavior makes it impossible to form consistent theories about the nature of being.",
          "isCorrect": false,
          "rationale": "Kierkegaard actually did form systematic theories about existence; the difficulty lies in the method of communication and the internal nature of the subject, not just behavioral variability."
        }
      ],
      "hint": "Consider the spatial and temporal location of existence compared to a scientific specimen under a microscope."
    },
    {
      "question": "Kierkegaard often used pseudonyms and 'indirect communication' in his works. What was the primary purpose of this literary strategy according to the text?",
      "answerOptions": [
        {
          "text": "To bypass the censorship laws of the Danish state and the Church during the mid-19th century.",
          "isCorrect": false,
          "rationale": "While historical context might suggest this, the source material focuses on the philosophical goal of shifting the reader's attention toward their own existence."
        },
        {
          "text": "To create a 'blurring' of objectivity that forces the reader to stop looking for the author's meaning and find their own.",
          "isCorrect": true,
          "rationale": "By hiding behind pseudonyms, Kierkegaard prevents the reader from being distracted by his personality, compelling them to relate the content to their own life."
        },
        {
          "text": "To demonstrate that truth is relative and that every perspective presented by a pseudonym is equally valid.",
          "isCorrect": false,
          "rationale": "The goal is not relativism, but rather subjective engagement; the text describes this as a 'shrouding' to prompt an internal search for truth."
        },
        {
          "text": "To allow for the publication of controversial psychological theories that he did not yet want to claim as his own.",

          "text": "It serves as a modern paraphrase of Descartes' Cogito, where the sensation of nausea proves one's own existence.",
          "isCorrect": true,
          "rationale": "Sartre transforms 'I think, therefore I am' into a realization where the experience of existence is felt through the overwhelming 'nausea' of absolute freedom."

        {
          "text": "It is a form of 'spiritual despair' that Kierkegaard argued could only be cured through religious faith.",
          "isCorrect": false,
          "rationale": "While Kierkegaard discusses despair, the text treats Sartre's nausea as a specific mode of existence related to the boundary of freedom, not necessarily a religious stage."
        },
        {
          "text": "It represents the final stage of existence where a person has completely lost their 'self-relation'.",
          "isCorrect": false,
          "rationale": "Nausea is actually a point where existence 'presses itself' upon the individual, making them acutely aware of their being, rather than losing it."

    {
      "question": "In 'The Sickness unto Death', Kierkegaard defines the self as 'a relation that relates itself to itself'. What is the implication of this definition?",

          "text": "The self is a static substance that remains unchanged throughout a person's life.",

          "text": "It is a dangerous distraction that leads individuals away from their ethical duties and into 'fantasy worlds'.",
          "isCorrect": false,
