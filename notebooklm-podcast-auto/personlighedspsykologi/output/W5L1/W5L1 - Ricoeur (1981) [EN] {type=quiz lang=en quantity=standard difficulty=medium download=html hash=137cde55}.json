          "text": "Desire as a meaning capable of being deciphered",
          "isCorrect": true,
          "rationale": "The analytic technique forces desire to pass through speech, transforming it from a raw energy into a semantic dimension that can be interpreted."
        },
        {
          "text": "Observable behavior in a controlled environment",
          "isCorrect": false,

          "text": "Direct measurement of psychical energy",
          "isCorrect": false,

      "hint": "Consider the 'talk-cure' aspect of the analytic relationship and how it screens experience."

      "question": "In the context of the second criterion, why is transference described as a 'playground' or 'intermediate region'?",
      "answerOptions": [

          "text": "It provides a space where the patient is safe from all emotional resistance",
          "isCorrect": false,
          "rationale": "Transference does not eliminate resistance; rather, it allows the compulsion to repeat to expand freely so it can eventually be transformed into remembering."

          "text": "It allows the patient to avoid 'real life' by regressing into a childish state",
