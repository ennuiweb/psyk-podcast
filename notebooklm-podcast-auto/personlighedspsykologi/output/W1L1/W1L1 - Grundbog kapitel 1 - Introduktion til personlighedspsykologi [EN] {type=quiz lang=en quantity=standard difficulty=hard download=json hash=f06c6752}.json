    {
      "question": "The term 'person' originates from the Etruscan/Greek word 'persona', which historically refers to a mask or character. According to the text, what fundamental distinction does this etymological root establish in personality psychology?",

          "text": "The distinction between the 'outer' social presentation and the 'inner' self that exists when alone.",
          "isCorrect": true,
          "rationale": "The text explains that a mask implies a social role performed for others, creating a division between the 'outer' social space and the 'inner' being that remains when the mask is removed."
        },
        {
          "text": "The distinction between pathological personality disorders and healthy psychological functioning.",
          "isCorrect": false,

          "text": "The distinction between the collective unconscious and the individual ego.",
          "isCorrect": false,

          "text": "Early medical researchers were uninterested in the functions of the human mind such as memory or sensation.",

          "text": "The experimental approach was better suited for isolated functions than for describing complex, integrated wholes.",
          "isCorrect": true,
          "rationale": "The text notes that natural science methods focused on specific phenomena like sensation or memory, which proved insufficient for capturing the complexity and 'wholeness' of personality."
