          "text": "As a positioning made available through discursive practices rather than an individual property.",
          "isCorrect": true,
          "rationale": "Davies argues that agency is discursively produced and depends on access to practices that allow one to take themselves up as a knowable identity."

        {
          "text": "As the ability of an individual to stand entirely outside of social and moral orders.",
          "isCorrect": false,

          "text": "As the successful acquisition of a neutral set of linguistic tools to describe the real world.",
          "isCorrect": false,

          "text": "Middle-class children are genuinely freer because they are taught to choose the 'right things'.",

          "text": "Progressive education is the only way to ensure students are not manipulated by their desires.",

          "text": "Individual freedom and agency can be a liberal humanist sham if desires are socially constituted.",

          "text": "That women naturally prefer supportive roles over active participation in competitive environments.",

          "text": "That being an 'agent' is not a necessary element of human action but a contingent discursive positioning.",

          "text": "That anyone can become an agent simply by choosing to pick up the ball and join the game.",
