          "text": "Essence is the concrete, unique manifestation that precedes any abstract definitions.",
          "isCorrect": false,

          "text": "Existence represents the universal, unchanging characteristics that determine what a person is.",
          "isCorrect": false,

          "text": "Essence and existence are 'equiprimordial' and cannot be separated in philosophical inquiry.",
          "isCorrect": false,
