      "question": "According to Klaus Holzkamp, why is traditional psychology's insistence on 'scientificity' and 'objectivity' problematic?",
      "answerOptions": [
        {
          "text": "It relies too heavily on qualitative data, which lacks the rigor of the natural sciences.",
          "isCorrect": false,
          "rationale": "Holzkamp's critique actually centers on the fact that mainstream psychology attempts to mimic the natural sciences, thereby missing the unique social and historical nature of human subjectivity."
        },
        {
          "text": "It is permeated by the ideology and individualism of capitalist society, despite its claims of neutrality.",
          "isCorrect": true,
          "rationale": "Critical psychology argues that psychological categories are not objective truths but are shaped by the societal structures and power relations of the context in which they were developed."
        },
        {
          "text": "It focuses exclusively on collective societal movements rather than the individual's mental processes.",
          "isCorrect": false,
          "rationale": "Traditional psychology is criticized for being too individualistic, not for over-focusing on collective movements."
        },
        {
          "text": "The laboratory settings used are too complex to allow for the isolation of specific psychological variables.",
          "isCorrect": false,
          "rationale": "The critique is not about the complexity of the laboratory, but about the assumption that the human psyche can be understood in isolation from real-world societal conditions."

      "answerOptions": [
        {
          "text": "It assumes that human actions are direct reactions to immediate circumstances, ignoring the ability to transcend those limits.",
          "isCorrect": true,
          "rationale": "This postulate suggests a deterministic relationship between conditions and behavior, whereas critical psychology emphasizes that humans can consciously relate to and change their circumstances."

          "text": "It overestimates the role of long-term historical factors in shaping an individual's current psychological state.",
          "isCorrect": false,
          "rationale": "The term 'immediacy' refers to the focus on the 'here and now' as a causal trigger, which is the opposite of overemphasizing history."

          "text": "It suggests that psychologists should only study phenomena that can be immediately observed by a third party.",
          "isCorrect": false,
          "rationale": "While related to behaviorism, the specific 'postulate' refers to the theoretical assumption of how people are 'subjected' to their immediate conditions."

        {
          "text": "Reason discourse grounds actions in the subject's first-person perspective, whereas conditioning discourse views actions as externally determined responses.",

        },
        {
          "text": "Expansive agency is a sign of psychological health, while restrictive agency is a clinical symptom of depression.",

          "text": "Restrictive agency focuses on individual goals, while expansive agency focuses on the needs of the state.",
          "isCorrect": false,
          "rationale": "Expansive agency is about the subject's participation in and influence over their own life conditions, which may involve collective interests but is not about 'state' needs."
