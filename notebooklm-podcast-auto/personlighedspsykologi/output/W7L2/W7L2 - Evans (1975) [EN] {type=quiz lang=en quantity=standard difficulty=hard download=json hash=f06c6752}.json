      "question": "According to the source material, why does Carl Rogers reject the homeostatic model as the ultimate explanation for motivation?",
      "answerOptions": [
        {
          "text": "He believes the organism's primary goal is to achieve a state of stasis by reducing all biological tensions.",
          "isCorrect": false,
          "rationale": "This describes the homeostatic model itself, which Rogers argues fails to account for the organism's inherent tendency to seek enrichment."
        },
        {
          "text": "He observes that organisms often seek more complex and enriching stimuli rather than just the reduction of tension.",
          "isCorrect": true,
          "rationale": "Rogers argues that even simple organisms, such as flatworms, seek out more complicated stimuli rather than just trying to achieve a state of stasis."
        },
        {
          "text": "He argues that homeostasis only applies to physiological needs and ignores the higher-order needs identified by Maslow.",
          "isCorrect": false,
          "rationale": "While he discusses Maslow, Rogers' primary critique is that the homeostatic drive for equilibrium doesn't reflect the 'actualizing tendency' of the entire organism."
        },
        {
          "text": "He views motivation as being determined by early childhood patterns that are too complex for a homeostatic model.",
          "isCorrect": false,
          "rationale": "Rogers acknowledges the value of tracing childhood patterns but focuses on the current forward-moving nature of the organism as the central motivational force."

      "hint": "Consider Rogers' perspective on the 'actualizing tendency' and how it differs from a simple state of equilibrium."

          "text": "Rogers views it as a distinct structural entity containing repressed irrational drives and sexual determinants.",

          "text": "Rogers rejects the concept entirely, arguing that man's behavior is always rationally determined.",
          "isCorrect": false,
          "rationale": "While Rogers emphasizes current experience, he does not claim behavior is always rational; he simply redefines the 'unconscious' as a continuum of awareness."

          "text": "Rogers describes it as a continuum of awareness where material moves between 'figure' and 'ground'.",
