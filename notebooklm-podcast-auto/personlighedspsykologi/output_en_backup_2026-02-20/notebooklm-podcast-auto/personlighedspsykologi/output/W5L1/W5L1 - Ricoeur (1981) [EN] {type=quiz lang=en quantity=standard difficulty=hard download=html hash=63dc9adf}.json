          "text": "The observable physiological changes associated with instinctual drives.",
          "isCorrect": false,

          "text": "The statistical frequency of a symptom across a specific demographic.",
          "isCorrect": false,

          "text": "The direct observation of the patient's non-verbal acting out.",
          "isCorrect": false,

          "isCorrect": true,
