      "question": "According to Freud, why does the study of symptoms serve as a starting point that is 'most foreign to the ego'?",
      "answerOptions": [
        {
          "text": "Symptoms are derived from the repressed and represent it before the ego, acting as 'internal foreign territory.'",
          "isCorrect": true,
          "rationale": "Freud posits that symptoms originate from the unconscious repressed material, making them alien to the ego's conscious awareness, much like the external world."
        },
        {
          "text": "Symptoms are physical manifestations of organic defects that the ego cannot control.",
          "isCorrect": false,
          "rationale": "While symptoms can have physical components, Freud specifically identifies them as psychical representatives of the repressed rather than purely organic failures."
        },
        {
          "text": "Symptoms represent the ego's attempts to dominate the external world through magical thinking.",
          "isCorrect": false,
          "rationale": "The ego actually views symptoms as intrusions from a 'foreign' internal source rather than as tools for external domination."
        },
        {
          "text": "Symptoms are the direct result of the ego's moral perfectionism.",
          "isCorrect": false,
          "rationale": "Perfectionism is a function of the super-ego; symptoms are the representatives of the 'repressed' instinctual life."

      "hint": "Consider the relationship between the ego and the parts of the mind it has pushed away."

          "text": "Mental structures break along predetermined lines of cleavage, revealing their invisible internal boundaries.",
          "isCorrect": true,
          "rationale": "Pathology allows us to see normal articulations because the mind 'breaks' at structural points that were present but invisible during health."

        {
          "text": "The mind is extremely fragile and cannot be repaired once it has been shattered by trauma.",
          "isCorrect": false,
          "rationale": "The analogy is used to describe structural fragmentation and visibility, not the permanence or irreversibility of mental illness."
        },
        {
          "text": "Every person's mind breaks into identical, haphazard pieces regardless of their individual history.",
          "isCorrect": false,

        {
          "text": "External reality acts as the floor that destroys the internal psychical reality.",
          "isCorrect": false,
          "rationale": "The focus of the analogy is the internal structural boundaries of the crystal itself, not the nature of the 'floor' or external world."

          "text": "The conversion of unconscious impulses into physical symptoms.",

      "question": "What distinguishes 'identification' from 'object-choice' in Freud's theory of the ego?",
      "answerOptions": [
        {
          "text": "Identification involves wanting to 'be like' another, while object-choice involves wanting to 'possess' another.",
          "isCorrect": true,
          "rationale": "Identification modifies the ego after a model, whereas object-choice focuses on the attachment to an external person without necessarily altering the ego's structure."
        },
        {
          "text": "Identification is a conscious process, whereas object-choice is always unconscious.",
          "isCorrect": false,

          "text": "Identification is only possible with parents, while object-choice occurs only with peers.",

      "answerOptions": [
        {
          "text": "The super-ego is modeled after the parents' own super-ego rather than their behavior toward the child.",
          "isCorrect": true,
          "rationale": "Freud notes that tradition and values are transmitted through the super-egos of generations, often maintaining a severity independent of the actual upbringing."
        },
        {
          "text": "Children naturally possess an innate 'cruelty instinct' that they project onto the super-ego.",
          "isCorrect": false,

          "text": "The super-ego lacks any connection to the external world and thus cannot perceive parental kindness.",

          "text": "The horse provides the energy, while the rider tries to guide it, but the rider is often forced to go where the horse wants.",
          "isCorrect": true,

          "text": "The rider (Id) uses the horse (Ego) to traverse the external world safely.",
          "isCorrect": false,
