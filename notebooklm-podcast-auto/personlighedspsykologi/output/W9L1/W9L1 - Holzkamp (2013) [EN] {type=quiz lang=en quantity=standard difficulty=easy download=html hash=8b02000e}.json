          "text": "Psychological research should focus exclusively on internal 'self-awareness' and private feelings.",

          "text": "The subject is treated as an object whose behavior is determined by external variables.",

          "text": "Reason discourse relies on statistical probability, while conditioning discourse uses qualitative analysis.",
