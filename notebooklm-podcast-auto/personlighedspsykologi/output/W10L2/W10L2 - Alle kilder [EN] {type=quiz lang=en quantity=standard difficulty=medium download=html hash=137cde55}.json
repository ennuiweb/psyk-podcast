      "question": "According to Foucault, why is a process of 'liberation' insufficient on its own to establish a state of freedom?",
      "answerOptions": [
        {
          "text": "Liberation only removes obstacles but does not define the ethical practices needed to exercise freedom.",
          "isCorrect": true,
          "rationale": "Foucault argues that while liberation is a necessary condition, the actual practice of freedom requires the conscious definition of ethical relationships and forms of existence."
        },
        {
          "text": "Liberation is a purely political process that has no impact on the individual's subjective experience.",
          "isCorrect": false,
          "rationale": "This overlooks Foucault's point that liberation is often a historical or political condition for the subject, even if it is not the entirety of freedom."
        },
        {
          "text": "True freedom is an innate human nature that is automatically restored once repressive deadlocks are broken.",
          "isCorrect": false,
          "rationale": "Foucault expresses suspicion toward the idea of a fixed 'human nature' that simply needs to be rediscovered or 'unconcealed' through liberation."
        },
        {
          "text": "Liberation is essentially a 'truth game' that focuses on scientific models rather than institutional control.",
          "isCorrect": false,
          "rationale": "This misapplies Foucault's definition of 'truth games,' which can include institutions of control and do not automatically constitute liberation."
        }
      ],
      "hint": "Consider the distinction between removing a constraint and actively conducting one's life ethically."

      "question": "In Foucault's analysis of power, what distinguishes a 'state of domination' from a standard 'power relation'?",
      "answerOptions": [
        {
          "text": "States of domination are characterized by mobile strategies that allow participants to modify the field of action.",

          "text": "Domination occurs when power relations become blocked and frozen, preventing any reversibility of movement.",
          "isCorrect": true,

          "text": "Power relations only exist within institutions, while domination is the natural state of human families.",

          "text": "Domination is an ontological condition of the human subject, whereas power is a purely scientific discourse.",
          "isCorrect": false,
          "rationale": "Foucault views freedom, not domination, as the ontological condition of ethics, and power is a strategic game rather than just a discourse."
