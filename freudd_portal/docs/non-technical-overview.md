# Freudd Portal (non-technical overview)

Freudd Portal is the learner-facing home for the study material in this repository. Its purpose is to turn static quiz and podcast content into a continuous learning experience where students can sign in, track what they have done, and follow a clear path through a subject over time.

From a student perspective, it works like a personal study dashboard. You can create an account, enroll in relevant subjects, and immediately work through all available quiz material. The portal then shows your progress through lectures and readings, highlights what is done, and keeps that state so you can return later without losing momentum.

It is also designed to add motivation. As students complete quizzes and answer questions, the portal tracks achievements such as progress milestones and streak-like activity so effort feels visible and cumulative rather than scattered across separate files.

For teaching flow, Freudd Portal organizes learning in a structured sequence (lecture first, then readings/resources), so the material feels curated instead of fragmented. It connects quiz content, reading references, and podcast material into one coherent subject journey.

In practical terms, the portal exists to solve a simple problem: static generated quiz files are useful, but they do not on their own provide identity, memory, progression, or a learner dashboard. Freudd Portal provides that missing layer while preserving the original quiz content.
