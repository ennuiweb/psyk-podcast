      "question": "According to Foucault, why is a practice of liberation distinct from a practice of freedom?",

          "text": "Liberation is a historical or political condition that does not sufficiently define the ethical practices needed for a free society.",
          "isCorrect": true,

        {
          "text": "Liberation is based on the discovery of a true, unalienated human nature that freedom attempts to suppress.",
          "isCorrect": false,
          "rationale": "Foucault is suspicious of the idea of an essential 'human nature' and argues that freedom is a conscious practice rather than the restoration of a pre-existing state."
        },
        {
          "text": "Freedom is the political process of overthrowing a colonizer, while liberation is the ontological state of the soul.",
          "isCorrect": false,
          "rationale": "Foucault actually defines liberation as the political or historical act of breaking a state of domination and freedom as the ontological condition of ethics."
        },
        {
          "text": "Practices of freedom are coercive scientific models, whereas liberation is an individual's refusal to speak.",
          "isCorrect": false,

      "question": "How does Foucault define a 'state of domination' in contrast to 'power relations'?",
      "answerOptions": [
        {
          "text": "Domination occurs when power relations become frozen and immobile, preventing any reversibility of movement.",
          "isCorrect": true,
          "rationale": "In Foucault's view, power relations are naturally mobile and reversible, whereas domination is characterized by 'blocked' strategies that limit the freedom of one side."

        {
          "text": "Power relations involve physical violence, while domination is purely ideological and communicative.",
          "isCorrect": false,

          "text": "Domination is the necessary foundation for all ethical practices of the self.",
          "isCorrect": false,
          "rationale": "Foucault suggests that ethics is the 'considered form that freedom takes,' and domination actually constrains or eliminates these practices of freedom."

        {
          "text": "There is no difference, as power is inherently a system of domination that controls everything.",
          "isCorrect": false,
          "rationale": "Foucault explicitly rejects the idea that power is a global system of domination, insisting instead that power relations are widespread, mobile, and require freedom."

      "answerOptions": [
        {
          "text": "It assumes agency is an individual property or innate power used against society, rather than a discursive positioning.",

          "text": "It fails to account for the biological differences that prevent certain groups from ever achieving agency.",
          "isCorrect": false,
          "rationale": "Davies argues that agency is discursively constructed, and the 'failure' of some groups to be seen as agentic is a result of their social positioning, not biology."

          "text": "It overemphasizes the role of the collective in making decisions for the individual.",
          "isCorrect": false,

        {
          "text": "It views language as a tool for social control rather than a transparent medium for describing reality.",
          "isCorrect": false,

      "question": "Foucault argues that the 'care of the self' is ontologically prior to the 'care for others.' What is the ethical reasoning behind this?",

          "text": "The self is a permanent substance that must be purified before it can interact with the material world.",

          "text": "It implies that individuals can never truly be agentic because their thoughts are owned by the collective.",

        },
        {
          "text": "It proves that the meaning of words is fixed and independent of the speaker's social history.",

      "answerOptions": [
        {
          "text": "The teacher refused to 'take up' the positioning or acknowledge the threat, thus excluding it from the active discursive game.",
          "isCorrect": true,
          "rationale": "Agency requires a collaborative recognition in discursive practice; because Mr. Good ignored the comment, Paulie's attempt to exercise power through that story failed to manifest."
        },

          "text": "Paulie lacked the physical strength to enforce his threat against the teacher.",
